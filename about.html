      Vincent combines field ecology, molecular phylogenetics, and population genomic approaches to
      address key societal challenges, from explaining the origin of biodiversity to finding
      solutions for its preservation in a rapidly changing world. Vincent sits on various panels and
      advisory committees, including the UK Natural Environment Research Council Peer Review College
      and the Royal Society International Committees.

    description: >
      Thomas is a microbial ecologist, interested particularly in patterns and processes in
      microbial communities across a range of aquatic and terrestrial study systems. His past
      research has focused on spatial patterns in microbial communities and the ecological and
      evolutionary processes involved in microbial invasions, which could hold particular relevance
      for understanding persistence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the environment.

    description: >
      Chris has worked extensively on the molecular biology, pathogenesis and treatment of highly
      pathogenic human coronaviruses. He is a new PI building a group studying the virus: host
      interactions of human coronaviruses at the University of Nottingham and is advising on matters
      related to SARS-CoV-2 biology and virology.

    description: >
      Nick studies problems in inference and dynamics in the context of sequence evolution and
      processes on unobserved networks.

    description: >
      Till is an applied mathematician with an interest in statistical models for networks and
      the dynamics unfolding upon them. After developing large-scale machine learning models for
      audio applications at Spotify, he now focuses on building inference pipelines to map the
      prevalence of Covid-19 in the population using wastewater samples with a focus on uncertainty
      quantification.

    title: Dr
    job_title: Lecturer in Microbial Ecology
    role: Co-Investigator

    image: /assets/img/avatars/emma.jpg
    description: >
      Emma is a microbial ecologist, with a particular interest in microbial community responses to
      environmental stressors (temperature, pollution) and the consequences these responses have for
      whole ecosystems. She combines field surveys, molecular biology, and large-scale experiments
      to elucidate key determinants of bacterial and viral community structure and function -– which
      is of central importance for predicting the transmission of pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, in
      the environment.
  - last_name: Woodward
    first_name: Guy
    title: Prof
    role: Co-Investigator
    job_title: Professor of Ecology &amp; Deputy Head (Department of Life Sciences)
    url: https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/guy.woodward
    image: /assets/img/avatars/guy.jpg
    description: >
      Guy is a freshwater ecologist, with particular interests in developing new gene-to-ecosystem
      approaches to understand how natural systems respond to stressors -- from climate change and
      chemical pollution to novel pathogens such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Guy sits on the Board of
      Directors at the Freshwater Biological Association and the Events Committee of the British
      Ecological Society, and he is the Deputy Head of Life Sciences, based at Imperial’s Silwood
      Park campus.

    first_name: Danielle
    title: Dr
    job_title: Research Associate in Freshwater Ecology
    role: Researcher
    twitter: Microbial_Bio
    description: >
      Danielle uses molecular approaches to measure microbial community-level responses to
      anthropogenic stressors in freshwaters. For her PhD, she investigated the impacts of warming
      on freshwater biofilm communities, integrating field surveys across the Arctic with more
      controlled, high replicability mesocosm and laboratory experiments. More recently, Danielle
      has begun exploring the impacts of chemical stressors on freshwater communities using the
      mesocosm facility at Silwood Park, Imperial College London.

    first_name: Sarah
    title: Dr
    job_title: Research Associate in Mathematics
    role: Researcher
    description: >
      Sarah studies the resilience of socio-technical systems in response to low probability, high
      consequence events. She is currently working on a project looking at privacy-preserving
      healthcare data for wastewater-based epidemiology.
